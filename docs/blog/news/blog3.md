Facebook should acquire Quora
===

Recently there's been a great fuss concerning fake news, this because people need someone to blame for their passivity and lack of scrutiny. That blame fell on Mark Zuckerberg and facebook. At first he dismissed it, but after he was blamed for making Trump president he wore a suit to show how serious he was taking the accusation.

Anyway, fake news has been blamed for keeping people in bubbles of blissful ignorance. I partly share in feeling the disdain, because I do not want to waste my time on fake information anymore than the next person.

### How should facebook deal with fake news ?
They should take on Quora's annoying strategy i.e to create a hierarchy of supervisors that police over all topics (to be more specific, news topics).

Let me tell you a story of how I was almost banned on Quora. I joined one day, and it was the best experience for about a week, I loved it. Then I asked the wrong question, I later received a warning for "insincerity" - outraged I was - I mean, who determines levels of sincerity over wire ?! The warning did not help, although disgusted I was also intrigued .. by what you may say ? Finding out how far I could go before I actually got banned! So, I purposely asked insincere questions, appropriate but insincere. After another week on Quora my account was suspend for a little over 7 days. I actually found reprieve in suspension, it helped me stop using Quora almost completely. Now I just hate Quora. Quora helped me appreciate the freedom that other networks like twitter avail.

### The moral of the story
Quora gives privileges to topic champions and punishes decent. The more questions you answer that are useful to other users, get you brownie points which make you a leader over certain topics. In Quora you get acquainted by "nudgement". Yes, "nudgement" into expected norms that are not really too obvious. This is meant to keep users in line. If you tread the correct path you open up more functionality and get badges plus better privileges. I personally elect to hate this method of governance - I feel it is a little bit undemocratic - but I cannot deny that it actually works quite well. Quora's policy deters and stifles outlaws and rewards those that get with the programme.

Facebook should apply the same policy to news vendors on its platform. If a vendor is known for fake news they should be down voted into oblivion, and of-course vice-versa. Dangers to be noted: this method of policing should only be restricted to news vendors, and may be content marketers. If this method is applied across all users there is a very good chance of killing the network altogether.

With that said, IMO, Facebook should acquire Quora to get further insight into how it's content policing model works.
