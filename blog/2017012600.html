## [State Surveillance](#state) 

A report by University of Toronto based Citizen Lab revealed that the National Intelligence Service (NIS) had acquired spy software Finfisher. A FinFisher server was found in a range of IP addresses registered to a Kenyan user named National Security Intelligence. FinFisher is a sophisticated computer spyware suite, written by Munich-based FinFisher GmbH, and sold exclusively to governments for intelligence and
law enforcement purposes.

Although marketed as a tool for fighting crime, the spyware has been involved in a number of high-profile surveillance abuses. Between 2010 and 2012, Bahrain’s government used FinFisher to monitor some of the country’s top law firms, journalists, activists, and opposition political leaders. Ethiopian dissidents in exile in the United Kingdom and the United States have also been infected with FinFisher spyware

## [Finfisher](#finfisher)

[ABC Australia][abc] has uncovered a proxy server for remote intrusion software [FinFisher][finfisher] in the Global Switch data centre in Ultimo, Sydney, which obscures the real user of the spyware, an Indonesian government agency. FinFisher spyware is marketed and produced by Gamma Group and sold to governments and security agencies to conduct surveillance.

The FinFisher proxy server found in Australia is one of many identified by Citizen Lab Senior Research Fellow Bill Marczak in a report entitled [Pay No Attention to the Server Behind the Proxy: Mapping FinFisher’s Continuing Proliferation][proxy].

In an interview with ABC Australia, Marczak said, `What it means is that the information from the targets who are infected (with FinFisher) is going through Australia before it reached the final master server inside Indonesia.` He added, `We were able to identify one specific government user inside Indonesia, the National Crypto Agency (Lembaga Sandi Negara) but we also found evidence that there were many other government users inside Indonesia, in other words many separate agencies that were using many separate deployments of FinFisher.`

Bill Marczak said that the uncovered list of governments using the software concerned him. In particular, the findings indicated that several countries with poor human rights records were using FinFisher spyware to target internal dissidents and human rights activists, including Kenya, Angola, and Saudi Arabia. He highlighted the fact that often, the spyware was used in countries without a robust rule of law, and oversight of intelligence and law enforcement.

`As early as a few years ago it was not possible for governments like Angola, for example, to get this sophisticated spyware capability. It simply wasn’t available` he said. `It opens up the field of sophisticated surveillance to anybody with a chequebook` he concluded.

## [National Intelligence Service](#nis)

<blockquote>We found a FinFisher server in a range of IP addresses registered to a Kenyan user named `National Security Intelligence.`  Kenya’s National Intelligence Service (NIS) was formerly known as the National Security Intelligence Service (NSIS).</blockquote>


Kenya’s NSIS replaced the former Directorate of Security Intelligence (DSI), commonly known as the `Special Branch`.<sup><b>[52][52]</b></sup> The NIS is known as one of Kenya’s security institutions with the biggest budgetary allocation—along with the Kenya National Defence Forces and the National Police Service—and considered to be among the country’s critical security organs in the new constitution.<sup><b>[53][53]</b></sup> In 2014, Human Rights Watch named the NIS, as well as the Anti-Terrorism Police Unit and other Kenyan intelligence agencies, as being implicated in abuses including torture, disappearances, and extrajudicial killings.<sup><b>[54][54]</b></sup>

The powers of the NIS were expanded significantly in December 2014 when the Parliament of Kenya rushed to pass the controversial Security Laws (Amendment) Bill.<sup><b>[55][55]</b></sup> The amendments came following a series of deadly terrorist attacks by the militant group al-Shabab, including the 2013 killing of 67 people at the Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi.<sup><b>[56][56]</b></sup> This bill expanded the powers of the NIS to monitor communications without a warrant, as well as expanding their powers to search and seize private property.<sup><b>[57][57]</b></sup> Article 62 of the amended bill authorized NIS agents to `do anything necessary to preserve national security` and to detain individuals on simply the suspicion of engaging in acts which pose a threat to national security.<sup><b>[58][58]</b></sup> Section 66 of the bill amended the National Intelligence Services Act, permitting the Director General of the NIS to monitor communications or `obtain any information, material, record, document or thing` in order to protect national security, without court oversight, leading rights organization Article 19 to argue that the amendment `effectively [gives] carte blanche to the Director-General to order mass surveillance of online communications`.<sup><b>[59][59]</b></sup> While a court ruling in February 2015 struck down some provisions of the amendment, the provisions enhancing the powers of the NIS remained.<sup><b>[60][60]</b></sup>
