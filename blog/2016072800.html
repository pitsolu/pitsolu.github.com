# [Fake Content!](#fake-content)

You may feel hoodwinked by some content marketers as I am. Funny thing ... I'm a content marketer myself.

## [How legit is the content ?](#how-legit-is-it)

Sometimes when we come across content i.e. case studies, research papers, infographics etc we expect they will make some kind of sense, at least at some point we expect them to be concise. It has occurred to me that the intention behind some content is meant to breadcrum consumers into supporting a misleading argument. 

Some content is quite unintelligible, facts cannot be verified because of the lack of them or because of their complexity. So, even if you delve deep into some of the content, and do your homework, you end up thinking this could have been made easier to digest. In some instances you conclude it is not worth the effort and time to filter anything out of such content any further. In other instances you accomplish your data mining only to discover something you would have otherwise concluded with lesser effort in another way.

After some spirited endevour to unearth the mystery of these so called master pieces of enlightenment, you discover you are kinda running through hoops. This begs the question why would anyone put good effort behind that kind of content? Why would a writer expect readers to act upon content if it cannot be interpreted into meaningful solid information? Sorry to say some academicians seem to throw their weight behind fake content because they are in fear of seeming like dimwits or being politically incorrect.

## [The deception](#deception)

Cooking up content that is leading to an already perceived conclusion is deceptive. Don't some content creators think that there are people out there who can see through their misplaced justifications, leading to their even more misplaced conclusions, which in turn would fuel actions that benefit them ?! (Everyone has or can build an intellectual capacity to discern what is true; anyone exercising sound understanding should be able to form good conjecture in any context; wisdom does not work against itself) 

I think research should at least be founded on some common sense premise. It is already proven that deceptive researchers can cook up research that is founded on true correlations that mean nothing. I suppose most people that come across such content are educated folks who have some good understanding and can call them out as garbage.

Good researchers should do the public further service of breaking down content into intelligible chunks. In some research papers the abstract section is just a complicated fail .. "If people cannot get what you have written on the abstract how will anyone get anything else ?!" - I remember one of my lectures iterated. Researchers should show us they understand enough of their own field to communicate it to people who don't. 

So, when you are out there reading some of the content, do not just throw it at other people because it seems academic or supports some conceptualized idea that backs some point of view you may have without confirming the work! Do the work, let it convice you first.

## [A lot of content](#a-lot-of-content)

There is a lot of content marketing out there because there is a lot of content. I personally think there is very little of marketing that is useful and makes actual sense, the rest that matters is how you apply it to different fields - in my opinion this is the main skill that should be sought after in marketing.

There are content marketers out there who are making a killing out of causing others to jump hoops. In my opinion I find this unethical and indignifying to the target audience - who will catch on to this sooner or later. If you care about your target audience treat them with respect and not as content zombies.  

To the audience: please do not fall for this kind of content marketing. If you do, you will demolish the fort of dignity that enables consumers as a collection to filter out content that is inappropriate. 

You know how I can tell marketers are stooping as low as to disrespect the audience : when content becomes misleading, when content does not address any issue or the issue it promised, and worst of all when content is sexualized. Just as a by the way, same thing goes for journalism.

## [Parting thoughts](#parting-thoughts)

Basics remain basics, that will never change even if they are printed on infographics. Do not put too much effort for a small pay off, if you do, then you are doing something wrong. There has never been a silver bullet - If you think you'll get anywhere without actual hardwork then you live in a fairy tale.
